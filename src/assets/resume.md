## Experience

### Lead Software Engineer - Planet Labs 2016+
Developer team lead for Planet's Mission Control User Interface. Reduced deploy times by 500% (yes, really), resulting in lightning-fast turnaround on feature requests and bugfixes. Spearheaded effort to reduce bus factor by authoring end-to-end project documentation. Dockerized frontend and decoupled project from the API server to reduce painful dependencies. Dramatically increased rapport with customer base by using agile practices to increase the team's accountability. Reduced project backlog from 200+ open issues to about a dozen.

About MCUI: In 2017 Planet's aerospace engineers spent over 1700 hours using MCUI to command the world's largest constellation of Earth-imaging satellites. MCUI leverages a fully modern web stack (React, Webpack, Express, Docker) to deliver the best user experience in the industry.
